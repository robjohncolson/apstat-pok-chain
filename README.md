## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ 
- Java 8+ (for ClojureScript compiler)

### Installation

1. **Clone and setup**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd apstat-pok-chain
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This starts shadow-cljs watch on port 8000

3. **Connect to REPL**:
   ```bash
   npm run repl
   ```

## REPL Validation

Phase 1 includes comprehensive REPL testing capabilities:

### Basic Algorithm Testing

```clojure
;; Test reputation calculation
(pok.core/test-reputation-calculation)
;; => 1.0 (Alice first correct gets bonus)

;; Test consensus calculation  
(pok.core/test-consensus-calculation)
;; => 0.8 (80% convergence with AP reveal weight)

;; Create test nodes
(pok.core/create-test-node "alice" :aces)
(pok.core/create-test-node "bob" :diligent)
```

### Advanced Testing

```clojure
;; Reputation edge cases
(pok.reputation/calculate-proportion-before-attestation
  [{:timestamp 1000 :payload {:hash "A"}}
   {:timestamp 2000 :payload {:hash "A"}}
   {:timestamp 3000 :payload {:hash "B"}}]
  2500 "A")
;; => 1.0 (100% proportion before timestamp 2500)

;; Consensus validation
(pok.consensus/validate-pok-consensus 
  completion-txn all-transactions 10 50)
;; => {:ready? true :convergence 0.8 :final-quorum 3}

;; Run full test suite
(pok.test-runner/run-all-tests)
```

## Algorithm Fidelity

Phase 1 algorithms port **exact logic** from reference implementations:

### Reputation System
- **Source**: `backend/app.py` lines 194-232, `final_simulation.rkt` lines 82-95
- **Key Features**:
  - Strict `<` timestamp filtering (excludes self-attestations)
  - Accuracy-conditional bonuses (2.5x only for correct minority answers)
  - Logarithmic weight scaling with `log1p(reputation)`
  - Bounded reputation `[0.1, 10.0]` with clamping

### Consensus Mechanisms  
- **Source**: `final_simulation.rkt` lines 52-59, `app.py` lines 116-141
- **Key Features**:
  - Dynamic quorum: `max(3, floor(0.3 * active_nodes))`
  - Progressive quorum: 2 for early curriculum, 4 for later
  - Convergence threshold: 0.7 for PoK block proposals
  - AP reveal 10x weighting for teacher authority

## Success Validation

Phase 1 meets architectural requirements:

- ✅ **Rep calc matches Racket**: Accuracy-conditional with strict `<` filter
- ✅ **Pure functions**: All algorithms isolated for REPL validation  
- ✅ **Consensus >90%**: Validated in test scenarios
- ✅ **Zero-loss merges**: 4-level resolution with pubkey tiebreak
- ✅ **Re-frame integration**: Event/subscription model for state

## Testing

Run comprehensive test suite:

```bash
# All tests
npm run repl
(pok.test-runner/run-all-tests)

# Individual test suites  
(pok.reputation-test/run-all-tests)
(pok.consensus-test/run-all-tests)
```

### Test Coverage

- **Reputation Tests**: 8 test cases covering proportion calculation, bonuses, bounds
- **Consensus Tests**: 10 test cases covering convergence, quorum, validation
- **Edge Cases**: Identical timestamps, empty data, boundary conditions
- **Integration**: Re-frame event/subscription flows
