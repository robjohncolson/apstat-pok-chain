The matched-pairs design is appropriate because students from the same law school are likely to be more similar to each other than to students from different schools, so pairing within schools controls for school-related factors that might affect exam performance." :attachments {:choices [{:key "A" :value "Each graduate was randomly assigned to one method."} {:key "B" :value "The law schools were randomly selected."} {:key "C" :value "Each method served as a block."} {:key "D" :value "The sample size was less than 30."} {:key "E" :value "Each law school served as a block, and the graduates were paired within each law school and randomly assigned to one of the two methods."}]}} {:id "U3-PC-MCQ-B-Q08" :type "multiple-choice" :prompt "A pottery school wants to study whether the glaze of stoneware bowls is affected by the temperature used to harden the bowls. The study will use 3 different types of clay because glaze can affect different clay in different ways. Eight bowls will be made with each clay type for a total of 24 bowls, and 4 different temperatures will be used. What is the best design to use for the study?" :answer-key "D" :reasoning "Because the clay differs in ways that affect glaze quality, blocking on clay type is better than a completely randomized design. This way, all clay types are tested at all temperatures. The randomized block design controls for the known source of variation (clay type) while still allowing for random assignment of temperatures within each clay type block." :attachments {:choices [{:key "A" :value "A completely randomized design.

Of the patients, 40 had knee injuries, 16 had arm injuries, and 24 had foot injuries. The researcher will use two treatments for the investigation: the herbal medication and a standard medication. After the patients are on the medication for two weeks, the amount of pain reduction will be measured for each patient. Which of the following best describes why a randomized block design is appropriate for the investigation?" :answer-key "D" :reasoning "The type of injury is a blocking variable, and treatments will be randomly assigned within the blocks. Blocking ensures that units within each block are similar with respect to the blocking variable, and helps to separate natural variability due to the blocking variable. Different injury types may respond differently to pain medication, so blocking on injury type controls for this source of variation." :attachments {:choices [{:key "A" :value "The 80 patients were selected at random from all patients undergoing physical therapy while recovering from an injury."} {:key "B" :value "The sample size was greater than 30."} {:key "C" :value "Each patient will be randomly assigned to either the herbal medication or the standard medication."} {:key "D" :value "Blocking on injury type will help to separate natural variability from differences due to injury type."} {:key "E" :value "Each patient assigned to the herbal medication will be paired with a patient assigned to the standard medication."}]}} {:id "U3-PC-MCQ-B-Q10" :type "multiple-choice" :prompt "A professor at a large university plans to conduct a study to compare the effect of online texts versus regular printed texts on student learning.

Of the 80 people, 40 were randomly assigned the medicated lotion, and the remaining 40 were given a nonmedicated lotion. At the end of one month, the skin irritation had cleared for 36 people (90 percent) using the medicated lotion and 16 people (40 percent) using the nonmedicated lotion. Analysis of the results showed the difference was statistically significant. What can be concluded from the experiment?" :answer-key "D" :reasoning "Statistical significance means that the differences in results were too large to be attributed to chance alone.
