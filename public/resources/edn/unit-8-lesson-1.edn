The conditions for the appropriate test were verified, and the chi-square test statistic for the test was calculated to be 4.01 with an associated \\(p\\)-value of 0.1347. If the significance level of the test was \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\), what conclusion should the college administrator make about the proportion of students who request online classes, lab classes, or lecture classes at two different campuses?" :answer-key "D" :reasoning "The null hypothesis is that the proportion of students who request certain classes is the same at each campus. Since the \\(p\\)-value (0.1347) is greater than \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\), there is insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis and conclude the alternative hypothesis, that the proportion of students who request certain classes is different at each campus." :attachments {:choices [{:key "A" :value "There is convincing statistical evidence to suggest that the proportion of students who request certain classes is the same at each campus."} {:key "B" :value "There is convincing statistical evidence to suggest that the proportion of students who request certain classes is different at each campus."} {:key "C" :value "There is not convincing statistical evidence to suggest that the proportion of students who request certain classes is the same at each campus."} {:key "D" :value "There is not convincing statistical evidence to suggest that the proportion of students who request certain classes is different at each campus."} {:key "E" :value "There is not convincing statistical evidence to prove that the proportion of students who request certain classes is different at each campus."}]}}]}
